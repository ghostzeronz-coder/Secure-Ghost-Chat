 * Stores one-shot "I have self-destructed" notices broadcast by a client
 * just before it performs a local panic wipe. Each row pairs a departing
 * alias with one of its known contacts, so when that contact next connects
 * its conversation entry can be flagged as a destroyed contact in the UI.
 *
 * The payload is intentionally minimal: no message content, no keys, no
 * ciphertext — just the fact that `fromAlias` is gone, intended for
 * `toAlias`. Rows are marked `delivered` once pushed over WebSocket so we
 * don't replay the notice on every reconnect.
